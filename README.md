# Intro 

Hi there 👋. I am Robert Huang, a university student from NJUST, China (major in Cyberspace Security).

Some repos were created when I was just a beginner in programming, so some of the codes in them might seem really foolish 😂.

I am currently working on the [SJA](https://github.com/roberthuang1024/sja-v3) project. SJA is a tool to analyse, compare and edit the Scratch files.
