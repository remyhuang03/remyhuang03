# Intro 

Hi there 👋. I am Robert Huang, a freshman from NJUST, China. I major in Network Security.

Some repos were created when I was just a beginner in programming, so some codes might be really bad 😂.

I am currently working on the [SJA](https://github.com/roberthuang1024/sja-v3) project. SJA is a tool to analyse, compare and edit the Scratch files.
